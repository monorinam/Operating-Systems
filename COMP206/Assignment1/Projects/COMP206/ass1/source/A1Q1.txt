Summary of the Linux Documentation Project Manifesto

The Linux Documentation Project (LDP) creates a free set of detailed documentation for Linux/GNU applications and utilities.

 The main goal of the project is to have a centralised documentation base for Linux/GNU topics, and to fill in gaps in documentation provided by utilities.
 
The LDP maintains guides on broad topics as well as how-to's. 

The LDP is written and maintained by volunteers, and is freely available under copyright.
